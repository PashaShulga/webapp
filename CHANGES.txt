-  Initial version

NEED FIX BUGS:

- Ok - figured it out - missing end date for the bundle. Can you make that a not-null field please? FIX!

- Please check for the start dates as well when displaying bundles, currently you only check for end date. I fix it.

- /previous - showing previous bundles - this isn't implemented yet (or I missed it). FIX!

- Please ensure an email address and $ amount are in the input fields - I can trigger an error by leaving them blank and submitting a credit card number. FIX!

- Appreciate this may not have been totally clear from the spec, but in the top right corner,
please print the details of the charity we are donating to (like in the pdf document I attached). FIX!

- pyramid_mailer. FIX!

- can you ensure that database columns that are required are nullable=False (bundle_id on content & orders,
charity_id on bundle and any others that are needed for the app to work) (the start and end dates)

- I really would want a bundle specific download page, which is not the same as the front page, and just shows the content for download.

- For an extra Â£50, can you add the user account bits back in - while still keeping the current checkout process
 and optionally allow people to create an account & login, where they will be able to see what they have bought in the past. Let me know if that works for you.

- For some reason the $25 field gets cleared when I reload the page - that might be browser related.
 How browser you are use? I don't know what it is a bug. I not front-end developer and I don't know what it is a bug:)
